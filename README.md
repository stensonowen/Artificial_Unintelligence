# Artificial_Unintelligence
Playing around with logic statements and operators. Any semblance of intelligence is based entirely on bruteforcing solutions with truth tables. Early prototype.

I wrote most of the underlying framework in February, but I intend to pick it back up and I'm trying to use GitHub more heavily (also I committed some stuff via Visual Studio 2015 recently, and I'm afraid that if I don't use the command line more than a GUI people will think I'm getting soft). 

Anyway, this program should store a propositional logic expression as an object. I started writing it as practice with tree structures and recursion, which the class uses heavily (each expression is made up of two expressions and an operator). It can currently evaluate long, nested expressions given variable values, as well as generate truth tables. In the future it should be able to construct an expression from only a string (it requires creating each expression individually before compiling currently), detect tautologies/contradictions (which should be pretty trivial), generate Karnaugh maps, and work from the command line. Introducing first order logic operators would be interesting, but I'm not yet sure how to do that within my current implementation. I might also add tools to manage high computing usage in the case of evaluating long expressions (because of the structure, the algorithm is very inefficient-- O(2^n)).
